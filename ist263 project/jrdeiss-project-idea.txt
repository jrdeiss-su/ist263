For my website, I would like to build a website that shows off and reviews all of the rides/attractions at Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure
in Orlando, Florida. While I don't actually live in Florida, my family travels there almost every year and I have formed some strong opinions about
which rides are the most fun. I want this site to be something that people can use to see the opinions of someone who has had a lot of experience
going through these theme parks so that they can know which rides are the most worth waiting on line for. There are quite a few, so I will have to
split them up into a few different categories on different pages. 

My Pages Plan:

Page 1: home page, tells a little bit about myself and interests, as well as about the parks.
Page 2: Roller Coasters
Page 3: Water Rides
Page 4: Other Rides

I could also add other pages for the new theme park, Volcano Bay, but that is only if I have time. Each page will be split up into a review of each
ride in its category with my own personal opinion and rating out of 5 or 10.
