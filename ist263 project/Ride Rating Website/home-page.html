        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! My name is Jon Deiss and I’m an avid fan of theme parks! Ever since I was little, I have always been really invested into the entertainment business, which is probably where my love for Universal Studios came from. I have been visiting Universal Studios Orlando with my family almost every year for the past 6 years, and I consider myself worthy of rating almost every ride in both Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure. I created this website to give readers the opinion of someone who has ridden these rides and I am willing to give my honest opinions about them. While I haven’t been on every single ride in the whole park since some of them I am too big for, I’ve given my opinions on which rides I really like and which ones I think the most time should be spent on. Please enjoy exploring the site!</p>
